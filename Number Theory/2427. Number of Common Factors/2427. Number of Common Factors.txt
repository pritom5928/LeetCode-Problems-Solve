2427. Number of Common Factors
Easy

Share
Given two positive integers a and b, return the number of common factors of a and b.

An integer x is a common factor of a and b if x divides both a and b.

 

Example 1:

Input: a = 12, b = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
Example 2:

Input: a = 25, b = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.
 

Constraints:

1 <= a, b <= 1000

        for (int i = 2; i <= endNumber; i++)
        {
